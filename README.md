# Comic-Book-Generator
This project uses the ChatGPT and Dall-e 3 API to allow users to select multiple different characters ranging from main characters to villains and to side characters to create a comic short comic book plot and then use that plot to create a Dall-e 3 generated image.

I used a previosuly made database on my local machine to populate the dropdowns. My schema is under the prisma directory.

To run this project you can clone the repository and type the command 'npm run dev'. You can then select many different Spider-Men or Spider-Women, villains and side characters (Uncle Ben for example) to then
create a short comic book story/plot and then if you're okay with the story you can submit it to Dall-e 3 api to make your very own comic book panel/image.
